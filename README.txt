This is a fork of an Arduino library for WS2801 LED pixels
(See: git://github.com/adafruit/WS2801-Library for original)

Pick up some LED pixels at http://www.adafruit.com/products/322

This version of the code modified by ph1x3r to clock out the data faster and to add the functionality of using the string as a X by Y matrix. Pixel manipulation routines are also included in the library, with examples in the appropriate place.

Some code sourced from the LEDPixels library by Ben Moyes http:www.bliptronics.com, modified by ph1x3r for the WS2801 chip.

To download. click the DOWNLOADS button in the top right corner, rename the uncompressed folder WS2801. Check that the WS2801 folder contains WS2801.cpp and WS2801.h

Place the WS2801 library folder your <arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
